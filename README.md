This is a Strava project built in Ignition.
Oauth Secrets managed in 8.3 embedded secrets.
Currently pulls Strava API v3 data within ignition scripting.
Able to decode and visuallize polyline into generic leaflet map component in its current state.
Ultimate goal is to have it become a exchange project that can be easily configured for anybodies account.
  - Design considerations are shaped off this point. Plus, API limitations that strava has for the free account. Alot of tag creation/storage for data because of these two points.
I will admit AI was used for parts of the project.
