This is a Strava project built in Ignition.
Oauth Secrets managed in 8.3 embedded secrets.
Currently pulls Strava API v3 data within ignition scripting.
Able to decode and visualize polyline into generic leaflet map components in its current state.
Ultimate goal is to have it become an exchange project that can be easily configured for anybody's account.
  - Design considerations are shaped off this point. Plus, API limitations that strava has for the free account. A lot of tag creation/storage for data because of these two points.
